# FBI: FrameBuffer Image Viewer

Current status: shows images but largely not usable yet.

Super fast framebuffer image viewer with the following goals:
- fast fullscreen (by default) viewing
- galleries of images
- vim keybindings, keyboard controlled
- works well with tools like `ranger` and `lf`.
