# IV

Developed on MacOS but should run fine on other platforms. IV was designed for terminal users, but is a gui app.

- vim keybindings, keyboard controlled
- fast fullscreen (by default) viewing
- galleries or single image browsing
- works well with tools like `ranger` and `lf`.

## Usage

```
iv <glob>
```
